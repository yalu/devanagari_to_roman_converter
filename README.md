Unicode Devanagari to Roman Converter

Found the initial code [here](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B3QLKzA0EHYWYTg4MTExYWItM2JhZC00YzQyLTkyOTEtNjhkMWE3MjFiODYz&export=download&hl=en).

Added few Nepali Proper Noun specific rules.

## Why would one use it?
This tool is useful if you want to convert Nepali Proper Nouns in Unicode Devanagari to Roman (basic Latin characters). For example, "नेपालमण्डल" converts to "Nepalamandal". It does a fairly basic conversion for now.

## Usage
Just open the d2r.htm in browser - GUI is selfexplanatory.
